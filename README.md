# CVE-2018-4407 reproduction

This is a simple reproduction of CVE-2018-4407, which allows you to crash macOS and iOS devices with OSes from before late 2018.

To use the program, replace `sourceStr` and `destStr` in *send_badopt.go* with your IP address and the victim's IP address, respectively. After running *send_badopt.go* for a few seconds, the victim's machine should crash.

See the original [writeup](https://lgtm.com/blog/apple_xnu_icmp_error_CVE-2018-4407). Note that this writeup did not include the PoC script, so I had to derive a viable exploit myself.
